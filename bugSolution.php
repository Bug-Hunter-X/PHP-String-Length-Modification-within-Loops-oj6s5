The solution involves creating a copy of the string before the loop begins and working with that copy to avoid changing the original string's length.  Here's an improved version of the code:
```php
$originalString = $myString; // create a copy of the original string
$length = strlen($originalString);
for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
  // Manipulate $originalString[$i]; //use the copy
  $myString .= "a"; // Modify the original string as needed outside the loop
}
```
Alternatively, to avoid such issues, consider iterating using a `foreach` loop over the original string (converted into an array of characters) and building a new string in the process: 
```php
$newString = '';
foreach (str_split($myString) as $char) {
    // process each character 
    $newString .= $char . 'a'; //example
}
```
For array manipulation: 
```php
$newArray = [];
foreach($myArray as $key => $value) {
  //Process each element
  $newArray[$key] = $value; // Add to newArray
}
```
This creates a new array with modifications, leaving the original array intact.
